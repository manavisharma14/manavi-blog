        <p className="m-8 justify-center text-justify">Hey, I am Manavi Sharma â€” a curious human who finds joy in building things, writing honestly, and chasing ideas that matter. I am always learning, always creating â€” sometimes through code, sometimes through words, sometimes just through observation.
          This blog is where I reflect, ramble, and record moments that shape me. Its part journal, part thought-dump, part quiet rebellion against the pressure to always have it figured out. You will find stories, lessons, half-formed thoughts, and maybe a little clarity along the way.
          Thanks for stopping by â€” stay as long as you like ðŸŒ»</p>
