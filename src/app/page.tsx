Hey! Iâ€™m Manavi Sharma, a curious human who finds joy in building things, writing and pursuing ideas that matter. Iâ€™m constantly learning, constantly creating, sometimes through code, sometimes through the lens of words, sometimes just through observation. 


This blog is where I reflect, ramble and capture my experiences while they shape me. Itâ€™s part diary / journal, part brain dumps, part gentle rebellion against the pressure to always have everything figured out. You'll find stories, lessons, half-baked ideas, and possibly find a little bit of clarity.


Thanks for stopping by, stay as long as you like ðŸŒ»</p>
