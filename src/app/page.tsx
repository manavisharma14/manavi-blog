            Hey! Iâ€™m Manavi Sharma, a curious human who finds joy in building things, writing and pursuing ideas that matter. Iâ€™m constantly learning, constantly creating, sometimes through code, sometimes through the lens of words, sometimes just through observation.  
            <br /><br />
            This blog is where I reflect, ramble, and capture my experiences while they shape me. Itâ€™s part diary, part brain dump, part gentle rebellion against the pressure to always have everything figured out. Youâ€™ll find stories, lessons, half-baked ideas, and maybe a little clarity.
            <br /><br />
            Thanks for stopping by, stay as long as you like ðŸŒ»
